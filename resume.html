      In response to a border dispute between India and China, WeChat was banned
      in India in June 2020 along with several other Chinese apps. U.S.
      President Donald Trump sought to ban U.S. "transactions" with WeChat
      through an executive order but was blocked by a preliminary injunction
      issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
      California in September 2020.
