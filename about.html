    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      WeChat is a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment
      app developed by Tencent. First released in 2011, it became the world's
      largest standalone mobile app in 2018 with over 1 billion monthly active
      users. WeChat has been described as China's "app for everything" and a
      super-app because of its wide range of functions. WeChat provides text
      messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast messaging, video
      conferencing, video games, sharing of photographs and videos and location
      sharing.
    </p>

    <p>
      User activity on WeChat is analyzed, tracked and shared with Chinese
      authorities upon request as part of the mass surveillance network in
      China. WeChat censors politically sensitive topics in China. Data
      transmitted by accounts registered outside China is surveilled, analyzed
      and used to build up censorship algorithms in China.

      In response to a border dispute between India and China, WeChat was banned
      in India in June 2020 along with several other Chinese apps. U.S.
      President Donald Trump sought to ban U.S. "transactions" with WeChat
      through an executive order but was blocked by a preliminary injunction
      issued in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
      California in September 2020.
