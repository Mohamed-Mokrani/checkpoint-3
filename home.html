      WeChat is a Chinese instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment
      app developed by Tencent. First released in 2011, it became the world's
      largest standalone mobile app in 2018 with over 1 billion monthly active
      users. WeChat has been described as China's "app for everything" and a
      super-app because of its wide range of functions. WeChat provides text
      messaging, hold-to-talk voice messaging, broadcast messaging, video
      conferencing, video games, sharing of photographs and videos and location
      sharing.

      User activity on WeChat is analyzed, tracked and shared with Chinese
      authorities upon request as part of the mass surveillance network in
      China. WeChat censors politically sensitive topics in China. Data
      transmitted by accounts registered outside China is surveilled, analyzed
      and used to build up censorship algorithms in China.
